Beard can load remote templates easily. You can then organise all your
templates in one place, so that you don't need to embed template everywhere
but just load any template whenever it is needed.

<p>
In this example, we will load some templates from the demo app <a href='demo/' target='_blank'>Addressbook</a>

<!-- we don't need any embedded template here
as we are gonna load the template remotely
