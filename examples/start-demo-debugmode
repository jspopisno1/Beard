Mixing two language together can easily break something. Most of the template
engines do not provide good way for debugging.
<p>
Beard.js tries hard to prevent the engine from being another black box, as it
make some efforts into making the developer's life easier.
<p>
Turning debug on, you can get all information of compiling and template
rendering.
<p>
In this demo page, you can explicitly turn on or off the debug mode using the link beneath
the description section. Note
that if you call .init() to switch the debug mode, this button will also change.

<div beard="Test">
    <!--@
    Please open the console of browser to see the log... or if you are using IE <9.0,
the debug info will just beneath the page.
    [`` d.var1 `]
    [`` d.var2 `]
    [`` d.var3 `]
    @-->
</div>

Beard.init({debug: true}).load();

var data =  {var1: 'value of var1', var3: 'value of var2'}
result = Btpls.Test(data);

result += '\n\n';
