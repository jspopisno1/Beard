<ul>

If the variable result is assigned as a string, it will be copied to the result
section and the content will be parsed in the result-html section as well.
<li>
If the result is not assigned anything, or it is assigned, but it is not a string,
it will not be copied to the result section then.
<li>
$result is the jquery object of 'result-html', if you have a console, you can learn
that $result equals to $('.result-html'). So you can manually append something to
$result or bind some events to it.

<div beard='HowTo'>
    <!--@ Hi, here is a button <input value='click me' type='button'/>. @-->
</div>
***
Beard.load();

data = '';

// assign result as false in order to manipulate the $result object
// you can try assign result as a string to see the difference.
result = false;

text = Btpls.HowTo(data);

$result.html(text).find('input').click(function(){
    alert('well done');
})
