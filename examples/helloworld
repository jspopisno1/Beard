Hello world is the very first example. You will learn that
[`` some.thing `] is the assignment template tag, similar to
<%= %>, and the
variable d, is the magic var which refers to the argument passed to
the template.

<p>

At the left hand side, there are all the examples. Clicking on one of them,
the example will be loaded into the page. It is a two-level menu.

<p>
Beneath are all the sections for an example. HTML is normally the template.
Text in HTML editor will be append to body before re-running the example.
<p>
Javascript section contains the js to compile the template.
<p>Data sectionis to define the data to be passed into the template.
In this section,
the template will eventually be run, and the result shall be put into
a var called 'result', in order for presenting the result of the template.
<p>
Finally, you may expand and collapse the section by clicking on its
title. Enjoy!
