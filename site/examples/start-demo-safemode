The compiled template will be more safer, if you turn safeMode as true.
Actually it is true by default.
<p>
The equal tag will catch any exception to ensure that the template can still
work. Of course, no one loves to break their own code. But in certain cases,
this can make it more safe to use 'dot' chain to get data from the input object.

***
<div beard="SafeMode">
    <!--@
    When refering to an undefined var, e.g.
    style="[`` d.css.width `]"
    @-->
</div>
***
Beard.load();
***
var data =  {css:{width: 'width:550px;'}}
result = Btpls.SafeMode(data);

result += '\n\n';

data =  {} // no css at all
result += Btpls.SafeMode(data);
