## Performance of HTML rendering

If you want to know the performance of rendering pure html text, you can check out [jsPerf 257](http://jsperf.com/dom-vs-innerhtml-based-templating/257).

Or if you want to know the performance of rendering pure html text plus rendering the html to the page using innerHTML, get [jsPerf 259](http://jsperf.com/dom-vs-innerhtml-based-templating/259)
